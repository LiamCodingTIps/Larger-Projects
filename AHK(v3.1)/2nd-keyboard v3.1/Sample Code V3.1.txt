; HELLO, poeple who want info about making a second keyboard, using luamacros!
; I suggest to open and read the "README.txt" file included!

; If you have never used AutoHotKey, you must take this tutorial before proceeding!
; https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm

; So you will need luamacros, of course.
; Luamacros: http://www.hidmacros.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=241#p794
; AutohotKey: https://autohotkey.com/




;-------------2ND KEYBOARD USING LUAMACROS-----------------

#IfWinActive ahk_exe Adobe Premiere Pro.exe ;---EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE WILL ONLY WORK INSIDE PREMIERE PRO. But you can change this to anything you like. You can use Window Spy to determine the ahk_exe of any program, so that your macros will only work when and where you want them to.

;There is no code here. T'was just an example.

#IfWinActive ;---- This will allow for everything below this line to work in ANY application.
# tippy(key) ;<--- this function will just launch a quick tooltip that shows you what key you pressed. OPTIONAL.
Anything inside of these square bracets ahead should be copied into ANY code you want to use your second keyboard for!
###[
#NoEnv
SendMode Input
#InstallKeybdHook
#UseHook On
Menu, Tray, Icon, shell32.dll, 283 ; this changes the tray icon to a little keyboard!
#SingleInstance force ;only one instance of this script may run at a time!
#MaxHotkeysPerInterval 2000
#WinActivateForce ;https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/_WinActivateForce.htm

^
^--- i would suggest if you didnt download the "AHK\2nd_Keyboard\Luamacros" in your "C:" Drive i would suggest to move that as it would make the Luamacros code work immediatally and this sample code work immediatally without any tinkering!
If (key = " [keyname] <-- you can see what key is being pressed by opening Luamacros and it will say it in the console, that would be written in C:AHK\2nd-keyboard\support_files\keypressed.txt 
[code you want to use to do things, like a hotkey or something of that sort]
^
^<- if the code you want to use is more than one line you will need to place { above the first line and } below the last line
