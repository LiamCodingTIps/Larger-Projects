Fixes Include: made the Luamacros code 20% faster to write to the keypressed.txt file, renamed the files in a more
userfriendly way and when you download the full code packagae from my dropbox you now get instructions on how to use and

Youtube Video On How To Setup Code: WIP (work in progress!) 
If you have never used AutoHotKey, you must take this tutorial before proceeding!
https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm
So you will need luamacros and AutoHotKey, of course
Luamacros: http://www.hidmacros.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=241#p794
AutohotKey: https://autohotkey.com/
I do suggest to download Notepad ++ for easy editing of the sample code!
Notepad ++: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v7.8.4/

  3c) -- Then, press any key on that keyboard to assign logical name ('MACROS') to macro keyboard
